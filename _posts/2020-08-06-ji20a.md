title: Variational Training for Large-Scale Noisy-OR Bayesian Networks
abstract: We propose a stochastic variational inference algorithm for training large-scale
  Bayesian networks, where noisy-OR conditional distributions are used to capture
  higher-order relationships. One application is to the learning of hierarchical topic
  models for text data. While previous work has focused on two-layer networks popular
  in applications like medical diagnosis, we develop scalable algorithms for deep
  networks that capture a multi-level hierarchy of interactions. Our key innovation
  is a family of constrained variational bounds that only explicitly optimize posterior
  probabilities for the sub-graph of topics most related to the sparse observations
  in a given document. These constrained bounds have comparable accuracy but dramatically
  reduced computational cost. Using stochastic gradient updates based on our variational
  bounds, we learn noisy-OR Bayesian networks orders of magnitude faster than was
  possible with prior Monte Carlo learning algorithms, and provide a new tool for
  understanding large-scale binary data.
